      <h2>My Journey Into Tech</h2>
<p>I currently work in manufacturing, but I’m looking to transition into a career in tech. Growing up, I was fascinated by watching technology evolve—from the early days of computers to the incredible advancements we see today. That fascination has inspired me to pursue a path where I can contribute to shaping the future of tech. I’m interested in many different areas, including data science, artificial intelligence, security, and game development, and I enjoy diving into projects that challenge me to learn and grow. I’m also excited about meeting other programmers to collaborate, share ideas, and build innovative solutions together.</p>
